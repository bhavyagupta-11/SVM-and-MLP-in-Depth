# Support Vector Machine and MLP Neural Network

> In this project, we built a Support Vector Mechanism (SVM) algorithm and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network from scratch and then
implemented it in a step-by-step fashion. We learnt the underlying mathematical concepts of SVM and how to solve the optimization problem using different approaches. For MLP we implemented the forward anfd backward propogations and implemented it.

> As a sample data set, on which our model is trained and tested, we have used placement stats
of a certain collage and an accuracy of 80.7% is obtained. Furthermore, the accuracy of can be
increased by using Hyper-parameter tuning.

>For MLP we took circles,moon,xor datasets to see if it could classify them and it could classify them with an accuracy of 99%

> Implementing the SVM and MLP from scratch enables us to build a deeper understanding of the fundamental and underlying concepts. Such knowledge will prove useful when exploring some of the more complicated extensions that build on top of this algorithm
